# 👋 Hi, I'm Hashan

I'm a PhD candidate in Data Science & Engineering at the University of Tennessee and a Research Assistant at Oak Ridge National Lab. My work focuses on applying **topological data analysis**, **Bayesian modeling**, and **AI** to real-world problems like the opioid epidemic.

This blog is a place where I share:
- Insights from my research
- Notes and summaries of technical topics
- Thoughts on data, science, and learning

---

## My Research Interests

- Topological data analysis (TDA)
- Bayesian spatial modeling (BYM, MCMC)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) in healthcare
- Computational epidemiology

---

## What I'm Learning

I'm currently exploring:
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Document embeddings for clinical text
- Data storytelling and science communication
