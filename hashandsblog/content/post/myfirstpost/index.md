Over the past few years, I have been steadily working and growing in the field of data science! navigating its steep learning curves, celebrating small breakthroughs, and wrestling with the occasional late-night bug that just wouldn’t go away. But it wasn’t until a recent conversation with a Senior Data Scientist at Apple that something clicked.

During our mentoring session, he casually mentioned that he is been keeping a blog to document his journey, sharing insights, reflecting on lessons learned, and even using it to connect with others in the field. That simple idea stuck with me. It felt like a nudge I didn’t know I needed.

So here I am, finally taking the step to start my own blog. This space isn’t just a portfolio or a knowledge dump, it's a personal journal. A place where I can pause, look back, and make sense of my growth. But more importantly, it’s a space I hope will be useful to others walking a similar path. I’ve started this blog with a few clear goals in mind:

- **Learning Out Loud**: I am going to reflect deeply on what I learn nad how I learn it. I want to document how I approach problems, the tools I use, and the thought processes that guide me. Sometimes I have intentionally chosen to ignore some small concepts and that has led to a lot of confusion later on. I want to make sure I don’t do that again. Growth is a not linear process, and I want to embrace the messiness of it all.

- **Growth**: I want to stay accountable for continuous learning and curiosity! I do spent a lot of time learning new things, but I want to make sure I am not just going through the motions. I want to be intentional about my growth and make sure I am learning in a way that is meaningful to me. This blog will be a space for me to reflect on my progress and set new goals.

- **Community**: Hopefully, this blog will connect me with others in the field. I want to share my experiences and learn from others. I am excited to hear from you, whether you are a seasoned data scientist or just starting out. Your insights and feedback will be invaluable as I navigate this journey.

I started this journey on a small, beautiful island called Sri Lanka, a place filled with dreams bigger than its shores. I can still vividly recall those early mornings, the quiet darkness of 4 a.m., the gentle hum of crickets outside my window as I sat down to study, driven by a burning desire that refused to let me rest. Those moments were tough, yet incredibly powerful. I knew I wanted more, and deep inside, I felt the strength to chase it.

From zero, with nothing but determination, I crossed oceans and continents, arriving here, in the United States, pursuing my PhD in Data Science. The path wasn’t always clear, it was filled with obstacles, doubts, and countless nights questioning whether I could truly make it. But that fire within me, that relentless hunger to learn and grow, kept pushing me forward.

I’ve come a long way, yet I know this journey is far from over. There’s so much more ahead, challenges to embrace, lessons to learn, and dreams to fulfill. I started this blog because I want to share my story, my struggles, my triumphs, and my growth. Perhaps, along the way, my words can ignite a spark in you, just as others inspired me when I needed it most.

I don’t know exactly where this journey will lead, but I’m thrilled to find out—and even more thrilled to share it with you.
